Passwords… \*\*\*\*

That one thing that everyone has to use but hates to remember!

In today’s day and age, it’s more important than ever to be secure with your
online accounts!

However, a large proportion of people still use the same passwords for all of
their different services. Or, they use a variation of the same password by
adding a letter at the end (Hint: These are not more secure 🤭)

## ❓ So what should you do instead?

Well, it’s certainly not easy to create (and importantly, remember!) a different
password for each service. Especially when the average person has around 90 (⁉️)
online accounts!

What you can do, is use something called a password manager! A password manager
is equivalent to a digital vault that holds all of your passwords! 🗃

Not only does it hold your passwords, but it will also randomly generate
passwords for each service to ensure maximum security and then auto-fill these
passwords for ease-of-use 🔑

Using a password manager means you only have to remember 1️⃣ secure password!

## 👨‍💻 Recommendations

There are lots of different password managers that you can use! The two I
recommend are:

- Bitwarden (https://bitwarden.com/) – This is a completely free option that’s
  good for getting into this way of living!
- 1Password (https://1password.com/) – This costs around £2 / month but provides
  an overall slicker and easier to use service.

Both of these services come with browser extensions to easily auto-fill
passwords as well as mobile apps for use on the go!

Using password managers means you will no longer be scratching your head to
figure out what password and username combination will work! And, I would argue,
is quicker than typing it out through the use of auto-fill!

I hope you will consider looking into password managers and the benefit they can
have for you!

I will endeavour to answer questions in the comments if anyone has any, this is
a learning experience after all for a lot of people! 😊
